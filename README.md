# spring-data-jpa-acl
Provides the entities required for manipulating spring ACL tables using JPA. 

## Why this was forked
Adds foregin key names matching those of sql script embedded in the ACL jars. This allows retrofitting of the JPA entities into ACL previously implemented via spring-acly only.
